# Reading notes for Codefellows

This is my reading notes repo to track all of my reading notes.

## About Me

My name is Gina. I am a student at Codefellows.

### Growth Mindset

To me, growth mindset is about believing that there is no baseline to ourselves that we must remain at forever. It is possible to push our own boundaries and grow to achieve whatever we set our minds to. To maintain this growth mindest I find it important, and I mean **important**, to:

* Stay Positive
* Never accept failure
* Always Google everything!

Afterall, in the words of Audrey Hepburn:
> Nothing is impossible, even the word itself says 'I'm possible!'
