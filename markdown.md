# Markdown

Markdown is a way to style web content. It is much faster than using html tags and allows anyone to easily style web pages. Using markdown it is possible to format text, much as one would in a word processor. With it one can easily create bold or italic text, lists, code snippets, embed images, and many other things.

Github Pages is a way to easily create websites which can be styled with markdown. Using pages and markdown in tandem makes it possible to author web content from one's repository in a matter of minutes. It is then possible to style these pages using Jekyll, which allows one to choose a theme to easily change the look of the web page.
