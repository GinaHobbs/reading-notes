An image's width, height and vertical/horizontal alignment can all be adjusted with CSS. Background images can also be used in the box created by HTML elements. Photo-editing software such a Photoshop can allow one to tweak the image's contrast to improve readability on the site if it is used as a background image. The background image position can also be specified on the site if it is not being used as a repeating background element.
