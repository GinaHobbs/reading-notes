# Questions

1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
```
  1. Less errors
  2. Code is more efficient
  3. there is more upfront time, but less time refactoring later
```

2. In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
To create/destroy data, such as users in a database, before and after each test begins.

3. What is one downside of Test Driven Development
One downside is that TDD takes a longer time upfront- you're not just slamming out code.

4. Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
I don't quite remember this one and am having trouble finding it.

5. Why REST?
I read that it is easier to understand for developers, I'm having trouble finding a better answer...

I'm super tired right now so I'm just going to summarize here at the top for this...
I'm eager to learn more about what was in this reading, especially more on classes and understanding the differences between ES6 classes and constructor functions. There are so many things I've heard about little differences between things, but I'm so overloaded with information I can barely remember it. I want my knowledge to be deeper.

Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
