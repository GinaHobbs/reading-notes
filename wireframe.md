# Wireframing

Wireframing is the process of creating the barebones elements of a webpage, usually by sketching it on paper or a whietboard. To build a good wireframe of a webpage it is important to ensure that the functionality of the site is clear to the user. This is achieved by moving elements of the webpage around until an ideal placement is found. Remember, the simpler the design the better; it should allow the user to easily navigate without taking any stlying into consideration.
