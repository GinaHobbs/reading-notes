## What is CSS?

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It allows one to style HTML web pages to create beautiful look pages that incorporate fonts, colors, borders and even animation. CSS uses rules that essentially tell HTML elements what to look like. An example of CSS is:

> `h1 {color: red; font-size: 5em;}`

The first part of this statement, the `h1` tag, is known as a selector. Inside the curly braces are 3 declartions which consists of property and value pairs. These designate which property one wants to change and gives a value for it.

A typical CSS Style Sheet will contain numerous rules, each adding rules to different HTML tags.
