## What is a Text Editor

A text editor is a piece of software that is used to write and format text. Text editors that most users are familiar with may include Microsoft Word, Google Docs or Notepad. These are used to draft various documents and style them to suit the user's needs. However, when it comes to software development there are text editors that have more functions that these text editors do not offer. These additional functions are code completion, syntax highlighting, themes and extensions. With these a software developer is able to streamline the code writing process and reduce fatigue.
