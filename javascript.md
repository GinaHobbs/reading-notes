# Javascript

## What is Javascript?

Javascript is a programming language that is primarily known for programming web pages. Anytime that a webpage is more than just a static page it's probably because of Javscript; it adds a layer of interactivity to web pages. Take a button for example. With HTML it is possible to put text in the button, and with CSS it is possible to style it to look like a button. Javscript would allow one to click the button.
