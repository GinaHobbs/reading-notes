# Git

## What is Git?

Git is a version control system that allows one to save different versions of a file and then revert back to them if necessary. Using Git with Github allows one to store files on on Github's online respositoy and then make changes locally. Once the changes are ready to be saved to Github, Git 'saves' a version of the file and remembers the changes that were made, then applies the changes to the file.
