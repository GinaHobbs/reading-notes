## What is Git?

Git is a version control system that allows one to save different versions of a file and then revert back to them if necessary. Using Git with Github allows one to store files on on Github's online respositoy and then make changes locally. Once the changes are ready to be saved to Github, Git 'saves' a version of the file and remembers the changes that were made, then applies the changes to the file.

## How to Use Git

There are several Git commands that one needs to know to use it.

* `git clone 'https://github.com/test'` is used to save a repo from Github onto the local machine

* `git status` is used to check whether there are any changes between the clones repo and the local machine

* `git commit - m "message"` is used to create an informative message that explains what changes were made and why

* `git push origin main` is used to save the changes made on the local machine to Github
