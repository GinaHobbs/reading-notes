# Images, Color, Text

## Chapter 5: “Images” (pp.94-125)
To add an image into an HTML page the `<img>` tag is used. It must include a **src** and **alt** attribute which define the source of the image and the text description of the image respectively. A **height** and **width** attribute can also be added to specify the height and width of the image. Stock photos are a great way to introduce images into a website; they can be edited with tools such as Adobe Photoshop. JPEG file extensions should be used for images which contain a range of colors and PNG or GIF extensions should be used for imags which contain flat colors or reduced color palettes.

## Chapter 11: “Color” (pp.246-263)
Color is important to a web page because it conveys mood and helps to evoke reactions. It is possible to change the background color of elements, as well as the text color and opacity. When choosing colors for text and the background it is very important to choose colors that have a high enough contrast so that text xan be easily read.

## Chapter 12: “Text” (pp.264-299)

Text is an important stylistic element of website design. There are many different ways to style text in CSS; the color, font weight, font family and more can all be changed to suit one's site. Text can also be aligned within elements depending on one's design needs. It's important to remember that not all user's computers have all the fonts that a designer may have access to, and the font will only render on a user's computer if it is installed. This makes webfonts a particularly good choice since it is either packed with one's website or read from an external site such as google's webfonts page.

## JPEG vs PNG vs GIF

>Use JPEG format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth. Use PNG format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos. Use GIF format for images that contain animations.
