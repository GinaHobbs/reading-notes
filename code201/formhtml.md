# Forms and JS Events

## Chapter 7: “Forms” (p.144-175)
Forms allow one to collect user data for processing. There are several types of form controls that can be used to collect user input such as:

* Text Input
* Password Input
* Text Area
* Radio Buttons
* Checkboxes
* Drop-down Boxes
* Submit Buttons
* Image Buttons
* File Upload Buttons

Once a user fills in a form and submits it the form is sent to the server. It is sent as a name/value pair which is then processed using a programming language. After processing the server creates a new page to send to the browser to alert the user that the form was received.
