# Forms and JS Events

## Chapter 7: “Forms” (p.144-175)
Forms allow one to collect user data for processing. There are several types of form controls that can be used to collect user input such as:

* Text Input
* Password Input
* Text Area
* Radio Buttons
* Checkboxes
* Drop-down Boxes
* Submit Buttons
* Image Buttons
* File Upload Buttons

Once a user fills in a form and submits it the form is sent to the server. It is sent as a name/value pair which is then processed using a programming language. After processing the server creates a new page to send to the browser to alert the user that the form was received. 

## Chapter 14: “Lists, Tables & Forms” (pp.330-357)
There are several CSS properties which exist just to control the appearance of lists, tables and forms. 

Tips for styling Tables are to:
* Give Cells Padding
* Distinguish Headings
* Shade Alternate Rows
* Align Numerals

Styling forms makes them more pleasing to fill out; remember, no one likes to fill in forms. To ease styling of forms and to make them look consistent across all browsers once can use the CSS file at http://formalize.me (Duckett 341).

## Chapter 6: “Events” (pp.243-292)

> Events are the browser's way of indicating whne something has happened (such as when a page has finished loading or a button has been clicked).<br>
> Binding is the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen and which element you are waiting for that event to happen upon.<br>
> When an even occurs on an element, it can trigger a JavaScript function. When this function then changes the webpage in some way, it feels interactive because it has responded to the user.<br>
> You can use event delegation to monitor for events that happen on all the children of an element.<br>
> The most commonly used events are W3C DOM events, although there are others in the HTML5 specification as well as browser-specific events.<br>
