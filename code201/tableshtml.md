## Domain Modelling
Domain modelling is the process of coming up with a conceptial model for a coding problem. It involves listing out everything the problem entails, such as properties or attirubes and even the constraint of the problem. It is essential to have a well established problem domain because it eases communication between various people, whether they be customers, managers or programmers.

Here are tips for building domain models:

> 1.When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.<br>
> 2. Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.<br>
> 3. Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.<br>
> 4. Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.<br>
> 5. Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.<br>
> 6. Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.<br>

> Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.<br>
> Functions can take parameters and may return a value.<br>
> An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.<br>
> In an object, variables are known as properties and functions are known as methods.<br>
> Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other.)<br>
