# Debugging

## JavaScript book, Ch. 10, “Error Handling & Debugging”
> Debugging is the process of finding errors. It involves a process of deduction.<br>
> The console helps narrow down the area in which the error is located, so you can try to find the exact error.<br>
> If you know that you may get an error, you can handle it gracefully using the **try**, **catch**, **finally** statements. Use them to give your users helpful feedback.<br>
