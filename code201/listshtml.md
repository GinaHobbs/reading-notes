# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

## HTML Chapter 3: Lists (pp.62-73)
HTML provides three different types of lists:

* **Ordered lists**, where each item in the list is numbered
* **Unordered lists**, where each item begins with a bullet point
* **Definition lists**, which are made up of a set of terms and their definitions.

For an ordered list the `<ol>` tag is used and for an unordered list the `<ul>` tag is used. For these types of lists each list item is inserted using an `<li>` tag.

For a definition list the `<dl>` tag is used. Each term being defined is added with the `<dt>` tag and the definition is added with the `<dd>` tag.

To create a nested list one can simply insert an `<li>` tag into another `<li>` tag.


## HTML Chapter 13: Boxes (pp.300-329)
Every HTML element has its own box which can be manipulated with CSS. Using CSS it is possible to control many properties of the box, such as padding, margin size, borders and visibility. Controlling these values is important when desiging webpages that look good across a variety of devices.

## Javascript Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” (pp.162-182)
