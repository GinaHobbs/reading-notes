# Introductory HTML and Javascript

## HTML Chapter 1: Structure
HTML defines the structure of a webpage. Just as in a text editor, heading, paragraphs and lists are used to give the webpage structure. The name of the HTML constructs that give this structure are called **elements**. Each element has an **opening** and **closing tag** and in between these tags is a word that gives information about what it does. In between some of these tags are **attributes** which are made up of two parts: a **name** and a **value** separated by an equal sign.
